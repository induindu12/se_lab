<h1 style="color:red;">advantages of automation testing in computer science and engineering</h1>
<01>
<1i>automated testing takes far less resources in execution as compared to manual testing.</1i><br>
<1i>automated testing has less chancesof error hence more reliable.</1i><br>
<1i>automated testing reduces the dependability of testing on the availability of the test engineers.</1i><br>
<1i>automated testing provides round the clock coverage as automated tests can be run all time in 24*7 environment.</1i><br>
<1i>automated testing improvesthe coverage of testing as automated execution of test cases is faster than manual execution</1i><br>
<1i>it helps to trainthe test engineers to increase their knowledge by producing a repository of different tests.</1i><br>
